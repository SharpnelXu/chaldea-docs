2021 April Fool's mini game.

Thanks icyalala@NGA for providing the FFO resources and synthesis pattern.

## FFO Intro

All servants from Mash to No.306-Galatea, Udon servants and Boss Elizabeth. Beasts not included.

The illustration of all servants(except boss) are divided into 3 parts: Background, Head and Body.

You can freely combine these 3 parts.

## Usage

1. First of all, import `ffo-data.zip` from the following url:
    - click download inside FFO page, if extract failed, please manually extract to `root_path/ffo/`.
      The true path of `root_path` refers to [Directory Structure](./app_setting.md#app-data)
    - Github: [https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/chaldea-center/chaldea/releases/ffo-data/](https://github.com.cnpmjs.org/chaldea-center/chaldea/releases/ffo-data/)
2. Select **BG**、**HEAD**、**BODY**
3. Click **Crop** to crop the region out of background, click **Same Servant** to use the same servant's parts
    - the full resolution of synthesized image is 1024×1024, after cropped is 512×720(BG size). The servant parts may exceed the BG region
4. Click save to save to local, long press image to show save/share options, click image to show in full screen.
