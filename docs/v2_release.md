## Migrate from V1

Enter **Import Data** from Home page, you can now import V1 data, sniffed data and FGOSim(webcrow) data.

When importing V1 data, only servants and items data are handled. All previous accounts will be added after current ones. Please go to `Settings-Accounts` to switch account.
 
::: warning
**Settings-Userdata-Import** can only import data that is saved by current app version. NOT for V1 data. 
:::

## Attentions
- Silver Fou is removed from plan now. Only Gold Fou is planned.
- More detailed future event planning, incompatible with V1 data.
- Search is disabled temporary.
- Server backup/restore is disabled either.

## Web Renderer

There are two renderer, HTML renderer and CanvasKit renderer. Also you can specify the renderer in Settings, the change will take affect at next loading or page refreshing.

By default, `canvaskit` renderer is used.

### HTML Renderer
Uses a combination of HTML elements, CSS, Canvas elements, and SVG elements. .

- advantages: This renderer has a smaller download size, can use system fonts
- disadvantages: page layout may be broken, like incorrect font size calculation.

### CanvasKit Renderer

- advantages: fully consistent with Flutter mobile and desktop, has faster performance with higher widget density
- disadvantages: larger app size, especially the first loading. Need to download then render Google fonts at runtime. It may take several seconds before you can see the correct characters.

### auto

Automatically choose renderer according to device info.
